# Flight Price Prediction

### **Business Problem**
• Corporate travel departments want to predict overall future business travel expenses: flights, hotels, vehicle rental, per diems, etc.
• Commonly measured with historical data, but not available for new locations. Software providers won't resell client data.

**Solution:**  Develop a big data solution to model and predict flight prices, a critical component of business travel expenses, using other data sources.

### **Goal**
Create a regression model to predict flight prices based on key criteria such as: date, airline, social sentiment (twitter based) and origin/destination.
### **Scope**
• Ideally we would create a model but all airports globally, but this isn't feasible with currently available sources
• Instead, as a test, we will design & deploy a model on a subset of total global flight prices: One way flights within the United States to the top 37 most commonly used airports over a 6 month period.
